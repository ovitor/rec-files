# rec-files

When we recover our files using [photorec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) 
for example. The software put all the files in different directories. They also 
recover a lot of files (depending on all used is the media that you want
to recover). This way, this little script separate files by their types.

You must change the following variables: `PATH`, `IMAGE_PATH`, `DOC_PATH`, 
`COMPRESSED_PATH`, `SONG_PATH` and `VIDEO_PATH`. Also you must install Pillow
python library.
